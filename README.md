# Neighbor

An ecosystem to help facilitate community learning, cohesion and development.

The U.S. has problems stemming from all parts of society, but one of the largest contributors is the constant trend away from community interaction. As technology evolves and becomes more ever-present it has also tended to push us further into our collective digital lives and away from the world surrounding us, in our neighborhoods and our communities.

Our communities are full of families and individuals with widely varying skillsets and knowledge. We all have strengths that we can share and through that sharing we can build up our communities.
